**Epic:**

This is a FAQ project where users can ask questions and answers the questions.
The new feature I have implemented is the user access control called User Type. 
In this feature I have distinguished the access for each user among three user roles: Admin, Super Admin and Member.
The user can select any user role from three at the time of registration. 
After user registers by selecting any of the user types, the website will show the user type in the Home page. 
There are also three different links provided for the different type of user access. 
Each of the link is linked with the type of user who has the authorization to use it. 
If the user registers as Member, and if user clicks on any of the two other links it will display the page with message "User type" page only.
This feature displays the access authorization for User Access Controls depending on the User Type which user selects at the time of registration in the website.

**User Stories:**

* Users registers and selects their User Type(Admin, Super Admin, Member) while registering in website.
* Users can see their User Type in their home page after registering.
* Users can see the other links in their homepage and each link has its own authorization type.
* Users can edit their profile pages in the profile link.
* All the users can create, edit and delete questions in the forum.
